# Diorama Components

This folder contains modified `.jsx` files generated by the following command:

```sh
npx gltfjsx path/to/model-file.gltf
```

In order to use baked textures, the meshes' materials should be changed to the following:

```jsx
// Inside the generated functional component:

const texture = useTexture(textureURL)
texture.flipY = false
texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace
const tm = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ map: texture })

// Then, use `tm` as the material
```
